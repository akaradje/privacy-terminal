# Changelog

All notable changes to the scoring engine and data contract.
`scoring_version` is written into every build (`STATS.scoring_version`) — the formula lives only in `engine/score.js`.

## 2.0.0-preview — 2026-10-15

DNA v2 engine + red-flag engine, added on top of the published v1 scoring.

**Added**
- `engine/score.js`: 12-gene DNA v2 (adds `hmeta`, `hnet`, `mat`, `pq`, `aset`; `man` accepts 0.5 = default-on; `tl` is 0–2), anonymity set measured in bits (`log₂(aset) / 20`), evidence confidence band, four weighting presets, `rankStability()`.
- `engine/flags.js`: 14 red-flag rules (CRITICAL/HIGH/MED/LOW) + `metricsFor()`.
- `data/schema/curated.schema.json`: gene values may be bare numbers (legacy) or `{v, conf, src, asof, note}`.
- `scripts/snapshot_history.py`: daily `history/YYYY-MM-DD.json.gz` snapshot (scores + prices) so rankings can be compared over time.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

**Fixed (review of the first v2 draft)**
- **Missing data is no longer zero.** A gene with no value is `null`; the score is computed over the available weight and rescaled to 100. `coverage` and `insufficient` are reported, and v2 is labelled **PREVIEW** in the UI until coverage passes 80%. v1 remains the score the UI ranks on.
- **`aset` now has one definition for every mechanism family** (effective per-transaction anonymity set), documented in `engine/score.js` and the schema. Ring-based coins legitimately score low on this one component and recover the difference through `man`.
- **Band capped at ±25** and scaled by evidence quality plus missing weight (it used to reach 48, which made it useless for decisions).
- **`brk` verified as a −15 penalty, not a reset**: XMR-like 79 → 64.
- **DERO repo false positive:** CoinGecko pointed at `deroproject/derosuite` (archived 2022), which triggered CRITICAL `dead_repo`. `REPO_OVERRIDE` in `data/enrich_gh.py` now pins the maintained repo `deroproject/derohe` (last push 2026-08-21).

**Changed**
- `validate.py` no longer errors on a missing `src` (it warns and treats the value as `conf = low`, per the blueprint) and now also counts bare-number genes, reporting evidence coverage as a percentage.
- `validate.py` never re-implements the formula: it shells out to `node engine/score.js`.

**Known gaps**
- Evidence coverage is 0%: all 330 gene values are still bare numbers. Phase 2 fills them with `src` + `asof`.
- Pillars S/D/T/L/R/U are not implemented yet (only P).
- `history/` starts empty — the first snapshot lands with the next scheduled refresh.
